# GLUCLAS 

GLUCLAS (GLUcose CLamp ASsistant) is an open-source software for suggesting glucose infusion rate adjustments during manual glucose clamp experiments. 

GLUCLAS is not an approved medical software nor a medical device. It should be considered as an investigational tool aimed at providing infusion rate suggestions that must be critically interpreted, reviewed, and verified by the clinician in charge of conducting the experiment, who remains the ultimate responsible for clinical decisions. The authors of this software decline any responsibility for medical consequences of inadequate suggestions.

## Requirements
GLUCLAS is developed in MATLAB®, but no license is required to run the software. All GLUCLAS requires is the MATLAB® Runtime (v. 2021b or higher) to be installed in your computer. 

You can download the appropriate version of the MATLAB® Runtime for your OS [here](mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html).
